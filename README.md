# Sudoku Solver (Recursive Backtracking Algorithm)
Created a python script that solves valid Sudoku puzzles or detect invalid Sudoku puzzles

#### IMPLEMENTATION
- [x] Utilizes a **recursive backtracking algorithm** to solve the Sudoku board
- [x] Contains a **findEmpty** function that recognizes zeros on the current game board
- [x] Implemented a **checkValid** function that inspects if a number is valid in the 
      given position by checking the current row, column, and 3x3 box
- [x] Can determine if a game instance is winnable or not
#### POSSIBLE FUTURE IMPLEMENTATIONS
- [ ] Create a GUI that would make interactions with my script more user-friendly, possibly tkinter...
- [ ] Produce an algorithm that would generate a random valid Sudoku in which users can interact with like a game
